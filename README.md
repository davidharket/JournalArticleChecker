# JournalArticleChecker
A python script that collects the names of all journal articles from a specified journal volume page (e.g., https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.bond.edu.au/journal/42001/volumes-and-issues) and passes it to the openai api to check if any literature is associated with a pre-defined context.
