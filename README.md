# JournalArticleChecker
A Python script that collects the names of all journal articles from a specified journal volume page on Springer Link (e.g., https://link.springer.com/journal/42001/volumes-and-issues) and passes it to the OpenAI API to check if any literature is associated with a pre-defined context.
